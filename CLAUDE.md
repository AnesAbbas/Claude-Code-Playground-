# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is an experimental playground repository for learning and experimenting with Claude Code in an interactive way. The repository is intentionally general-purpose and open-ended to facilitate exploration of Claude Code's capabilities.

## Development Approach

Since this is a learning and experimentation repository:
- Feel free to create new projects, examples, and experiments in any language or framework
- Each experiment or project should be self-contained in its own directory
- When creating new experiments, include a README.md explaining what the experiment demonstrates
- No strict structure is enforced - the repository is designed for flexibility and exploration
