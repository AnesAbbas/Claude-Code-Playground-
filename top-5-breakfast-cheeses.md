## Quick Melting Tips

- **Lower heat is better:** Most cheeses melt best at medium or medium-low heat to prevent separation and maintain creamy texture
- **Shred yourself when possible:** Pre-shredded cheeses contain anti-caking agents that can affect melting smoothness
- **Add near the end:** For scrambled eggs and omelets, add cheese in the final stages of cooking for optimal melt
- **Use coverage:** In sandwiches, ensure cheese covers most of the surface to melt evenly
- **Let it rest slightly:** Remove from heat 30 seconds after cheese melts for best texture

## Storage and Selection

- Buy cheese from a quality source - better cheese melts better
- For best results, use cheese within 2-3 weeks of purchase
- Room temperature cheese melts more evenly than cold cheese
- Mix and match cheeses for interesting flavor combinations
